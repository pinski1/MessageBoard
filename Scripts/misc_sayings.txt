Perfect is the enemy of done.
Done is the engine of more.
We have a stategic plan, it\'s called doing things.
This is a do-ocracy.
Put your stuff away.
Talk is cheap, talk less do more.
Got something old? Make it new!
Got something new? Make it!
Get excited and make things.
Keep this space tidy.
Know where the first aid box is.
Got a project? Finish it!
Do something great, you only get out what you put in.
Be excellent to each other.
Warning! Raspberry Pi users operate in this area.
Leave this space tidier than you found it.
Do not be on fire.
